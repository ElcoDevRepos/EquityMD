# Investment Tracking System Update

## Overview

This update replaces the capital raised metrics with investment request counts for confidentiality between syndicators and investors. The system now tracks investment request amounts from investors instead of disclosed capital raised amounts.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### New Table: `investment_requests`
```sql
CREATE TABLE investment_requests (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    deal_id UUID NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'withdrawn')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Updated TypeScript Types
- Added `InvestmentRequest` interface in `src/types/database.ts`

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

#### DealDetails Page (`src/pages/DealDetails.tsx`)
- **Removed**: Capital raised progress bar and metrics
- **Added**: Investment request count display with loading skeleton
- **Added**: Tooltip explaining investment request count
- **Added**: Enhanced SEO meta tags for better search visibility
- **Added**: Real-time count fetching from `investment_requests` table

#### MessageModal Component (`src/components/MessageModal.tsx`)
- **Enhanced**: Investment form with better validation
- **Added**: Investment amount range validation ($1,000 - $100,000)
- **Updated**: Label to "Request Your Investment Amount"
- **Added**: Automatic saving to `investment_requests` table
- **Added**: Success toast notifications with react-hot-toast
- **Added**: Better placeholder and help text

### 3. Development Tools

#### MigrationHelper Component (`src/components/MigrationHelper.tsx`)
- Admin-only component for running database migrations
- Safely creates `investment_requests` table with proper RLS policies
- Visible only to admin users

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- React application with TypeScript
- Supabase database access
- `react-hot-toast` (already installed)

2. Login as an admin user
3. Visit any deal page (e.g., `/deals/san-diego-multi-family-offering`)
4. Click the "Create investment_requests Table" button in the bottom-right corner
5. Verify the table was created successfully

#### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
1. Access your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250609_create_investment_requests_table.sql`

### Deployment Steps
1. Ensure database migration is completed
2. Build the application: `npm run build`
3. Deploy to your hosting platform
4. Test investment request functionality

## API Endpoints

### Investment Requests

- `PUT /investment_requests/:id` - Update request status

### Deal Statistics

- Real-time updates when new requests are submitted

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/deals/[deal-slug]`
3. Test investment request count display
4. Test investment form submission
5. Verify data persistence in Supabase

### Investment Flow Testing
1. **As Investor**:
   - Click "Invest Now" on a deal page
   - Fill out investment amount ($1,000 - $100,000)
   - Submit form and verify success toast
   - Check that investment request count updates

2. **As Syndicator**:
   - Login as syndicator account
   - View deals you've created
   - Verify you can see investment request counts

3. **As Admin**:
   - Access admin dashboard
   - View all investment requests
   - Test migration helper functionality

## SEO Improvements

### Updated Meta Tags

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Responsive Design Features

- **Investment Form**: Mobile-optimized input fields
- **Tooltips**: Touch-friendly on mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Consistent across devices

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Investment amounts are stored securely in database
- Row Level Security prevents unauthorized access
- Input validation prevents SQL injection
- HTTPS encryption for all communications

### Privacy Features
- No public disclosure of capital raised amounts
- Individual investment amounts remain private
- Only aggregate request counts are displayed
- Syndicator-investor confidentiality maintained

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Errors
- Ensure you have admin access to run migrations
- Check database connection and permissions
- Verify foreign key constraints exist (deals table)

#### Investment Form Issues
- Check amount validation (must be between $1,000-$100,000)
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Verify deal_id is valid

#### Count Display Issues
- Check investment_requests table exists
- Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
- Ensure deal_id matches properly

### Debug Tools
- Browser developer console for client-side errors
- Supabase logs for database queries
- Network tab for API request/response debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Investment request management dashboard for syndicators
- Email notifications for new investment requests
- Investment amount ranges and filtering
- Historical request tracking and analytics

### Performance Optimizations
- Caching of investment request counts
- Pagination for large request lists
